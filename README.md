# SupermarketsAPI

This small project represents a simple day of our work. It has been downsized to assess
some of your skills, but without being a hindrance or burdensome. We have 3 (three)
modules to implement, as below:
This modular/conceptual approach is a high-level perspective to help developers plan
without losing focus of the bigger picture for this mockup:
(1) A basic set of frontend screens to connect inputs to the APIs and the database;
2 /7 L3 CONFIDENTIAL TRAINING MOCKUP A.I. FOR FASHION
(2) An API written in Node.js, to be uploaded on Amazon’s Beanstalk;
(3) Minimal cloud understanding, such as connecting the API with both the frontend and
the database on Atlas DaaS, for example;
(4) Storing the webpage on Digital Ocean or equivalent service;
(5) Storing data on Amazon’s S3 Storage.
System integration and buildup, allowing proper CRUDs to be made correctly, connecting
through the API and reading the database are essential. All services on live mode, with no
local host or emulated environments.
